# Tackling-Port-Congestion-with-Data-Driven-Intelligence

This project tackled the real-world challenge of port congestion, a growing issue in global trade amplified by strategies like China+1. We developed an end-to-end solution that combined data integration, feature engineering, machine learning, and time series forecasting to provide actionable insights for port operations.

Project Highlights:

**Data Acquisition & Integration:** Consolidated data from multiple maritime sources for comprehensive analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis & Feature Engineering**: Created features such as TEUs/hour, turnaround time, and vessel throughput.

**Machine Learning Modeling**: Built Logistic Regression and Random Forest models to classify congestion levels and estimate delays.

**Time Series Forecasting:** Used Facebook Prophet to predict weekly congestion trends.

**Visualization & Dashboard Delivery:** Developed an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize predicted congestion and cargo movement.
